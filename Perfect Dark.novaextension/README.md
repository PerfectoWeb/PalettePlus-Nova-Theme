## Installation

If you're a proud owner of [Nova](https://panic.com/nova), you ought to be able to go to **Extensions > Extensions Library > Themes (tab)** and pick the theme from there.

If that doesn't work, just clone this project (or download it from the releases page), it'll magically turn into a 'component' thingy, and you can then double-click it to add this theme to Nova!

## Disclaimer

[Nova](https://panic.com/nova) is the new editor from [Panic Inc](https://panic.com).
